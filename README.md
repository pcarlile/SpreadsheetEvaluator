# Spreadsheet evaluator

Simple evaluator of spreadsheet expressions

## Description

A spreadsheet consists of a two-dimensional array of cells. Columns are
identified using letters and rows by numbers (C2 references a cell in
column 3, row 2). Each cell contains either a number or an expression.
Expressions contain integers, floating point numbers, cell references,
and operators ('+', '-') and are evaluated with the usual rules of
evaluation.

This program reads in the spreadsheet, evaluates the value of each cell,
and outputs the value to the console.

## Getting Started
